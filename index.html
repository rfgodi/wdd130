        <p>Hello, my name is Robert Farai Godi. I come from Zimbabwe and I am 21 years old. I love playing volleyball,
            watching anime, reading poetry, and exploring business ideas. I also have a strong passion for agriculture
            and its potential to transform lives. I am studying this course to gain skills in web development and
            software creation, so that I will be able to use those skills in my future career as a software developer.
            My dream is to one day enhance the use of smart agriculture by integrating modern software solutions into
            farming practices. I am looking forward to learning all that this course has to offer, and I am truly
            excited to begin this journey. </p>

        <p>Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa, bordered by Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa, and
            Botswana. Officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, it is known for its capital, Harare, its plateau-based
            geography, and the famous Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River. Historically, it is the home of the
            ancient Great Zimbabwe ruins and gained independence in 1980 after a long period of colonial rule.</p>
