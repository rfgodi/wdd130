            Hello, my name is Robert Farai Godi. I am from Zimbabwe and I am 21 years old. I enjoy playing volleyball,
            watching anime, and spending time appreciating well-written poetry. One of my greatest passions is
            agriculture. I believe agriculture is not just the backbone of many economies,
            especially in Africa, but also a powerful tool for sustainability and growth. With the right technology, it
            can be transformed into a smarter, more efficient industry. I am studying this course to gain
            skills in web development and software engineering. My goal is to combine my love for technology
            with my passion for agriculture to help drive innovation in smart farming. I envision a future where modern
            software solutions can help farmers monitor crops, manage resources more efficiently, and increase
            productivity while protecting the environment. This course is an exciting opportunity for me to build a
            strong foundation for my career, and I am eager to learn everything it has to offer. I believe the knowledge
            I gain here will empower me to make meaningful contributions to both the tech industry and the agricultural
            sector.

        <p>Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa, bordered by Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa, and
            Botswana. Officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, it is known for its capital, Harare, its plateau-based
            geography, and the famous Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River. Historically, it is the home of the
            ancient Great Zimbabwe ruins and gained independence in 1980 after a long period of colonial rule.</p>
