        <p>Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa, bordered by Zambia, Mozambique, South Africa, and
            Botswana. Officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, it is known for its capital, Harare, its plateau-based
            geography, and the famous Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River. Historically, it is the home of the
            ancient Great Zimbabwe ruins and gained independence in 1980 after a long period of colonial rule.</p>
