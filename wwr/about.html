                    History
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our rafting journey began in 2018 with a small group of friends who loved exploring rivers and the
                    outdoors. What started as a hobby quickly grew into something more. We realized how much joy and
                    adventure rafting could bring to others, so we decided to start a company.
                    Since then, we’ve taken people from all walks of life on exciting river adventures. Whether it’s
                    their first time or they’re experienced rafters, we make sure everyone has fun and stays safe.
                    Today, we’re proud to offer guided tours that combine nature, excitement, and unforgettable
                    memories.
